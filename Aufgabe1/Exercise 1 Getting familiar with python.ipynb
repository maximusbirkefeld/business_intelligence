    "# The Python Programming Language\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is programming language developed by Guido von Rossum. The central paradigm of python is readability. Python philosophy is cherishing the art of making things easy to understand. With the growing processor power of modern computers python experienced a boost of attention especially because of its easy-to-use machine learning packages and open source character. Some of those famous machine learning packages are `scikit-learn`, google's `tensorflow` or meta's `pytorch`.\n",

    "If you want to know more about the core of python philosophy you might want to read the `Zen of Python`... For further explanation you could read Kateryna Koidan's [article](https://learnpython.com/blog/zen-of-python/) about it.\n",

    "# Variables and Lists\n",
    "\n",
    "Everything in a computer program is always built out of variables in some shape or form. Variables hold the information which is processed during execution of the program. Everything is characterized by a datatype. Numerical datatypes in python are for example ``integer`` or ``float``. Other datatypes are ``boolean`` which is the datatype for binary values or ``string`` for all variables that contain characters. Python will assume a datatype for a variable based on the value you assign to it.\n",
    "\n",
    "The names you choose for a variable should express the purpose of the variable to keep the code understandable for others or your future self. Keep that in mind when defining a new variable. <strong>Simple is better than complex.</strong>\n",
    "\n",
    "Multiple variables can be stacked in a list. You can create a list simply by wrapping square brackets around values or variables and separating them by commas. There's no need to worry about a datatype for a list because it can hold multiple items of different datatypes. Every item in a list can be accessed by its position in the list. The positions in a list also known as ``index`` are identified by integer numbers and start at 0.\n",

    "- Print the types of your three variables using ``print`` and python's ``type`` function.\n",
    "- Create a python list ``first_list`` of the three variables by using square bracktes ``[``, ``]`` and print it.\n",

    "- Print ``second_list``.\n",
    "- Calculate the difference between the second value in ``first_list`` and the first value in ``second_list``. Access the values via the lists integer index and save the difference to a new variable ``difference``.\n",

    "# Selection and Repetition\n",
    "\n",
    "The second main component of every programming language consists of the concept Selection and Repetition. They allow for checking a condition while making calculations and repeating calculations until a condition is met. Selection can be implemented in Python by using the keyword ``if``, specifying a condition, adding a colon followed by the commands on what to do if the condition is met. The code that shall be executed when the specified condition is met needs to be indented. Every ``if``-block needs at least one indented line of code or it will cause an error. The ``if``-block can also be extended by ``else``. The code after ``else`` is only executed if the condition of the preceding ``if`` block is not met. Multiple conditions can be concatenated by using ``elif`` after implementing an ``if``-block. When executed every condition will be checked and only the code whose ``if`` or ``elif`` conditions are met will be executed. \n",
    "\n",
    "Repetition expands the concept of selection by executing the code multiple times until a condition is met. Because of their nature of \"looping\" code the repetition structures are also often called ``loops``. The main keywords for repetition in python are ``for`` and ``while``.They essentially do the same but their syntax is different. The syntax of repetition with ``while`` is almost the same as the syntax of an ``if``-block the only differences is that the code is executed multiple times until a condition is met. Repetition with ``for`` implements conditions a little more implicit than explicitly writing them out, but may be the more intuitive approach for most people.\n",
